# IGLOO2 Creative Development Board RISC-V Device Programming 

This folder includes two FlashPro Express projects that can be used to program the development boards FPGA. A standalone installer for FlashPro Express is available [here](https://www.microsemi.com/products/fpga-soc/design-resources/programming/flashpro#software) . Please note that you only need to install this standalone version of FlashPro Express if you do not have Libero tools installed.

### PROC_SUBSYSTEM_BaseDesign
This folder contains a simple RISCV design which allows users to use basic peripherals such as GPIO, UART and Timers. 

### PROC_SUBSYSTEM_TickTackToe
This folder contains the design used along side of the TickTackToe example software found [here](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/M2GL025-Creative-Board/tree/master/ExampleSoftware). To use this deisgn a daughter board is needed from Adafruit, more information on this can be found [here](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1651).
